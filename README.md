# Computer_vision_projects

This repository contains the projects I have worked on as part of computer vision course at the Northeastern University. The projects are implemented using C++, OpenCV and PyTorch.
The projects are as follows:
* **Project 1**: Real time filtering using OpenCV and C++ on a webcam feed.
* **Project 2**: Content based image retrieval using OpenCV and C++.
* **Project 3**: Real time 2D object detection using OpenCV and C++.
* **Project 4**: Camera calibration and augmented reality using OpenCV and C++.
* **Project 5**: MNIST digit classification using PyTorch.
